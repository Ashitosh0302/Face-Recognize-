# Face Recognition System using PCA (Eigenfaces) and ANN

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Face Recognition System** using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, also known as the **Eigenfaces method**, combined with an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** for classification.

The system performs face image preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, classification, performance evaluation, and **impostor rejection testing** using prediction confidence thresholds.

## 🧠 Methodology

### 1. Image Preprocessing
- Images are loaded from the dataset
- Converted to grayscale
- Resized to **100 × 100 pixels**
- Normalized to range **[0, 1]**
- Flattened into vectors

---

### 2. Feature Extraction (PCA – Eigenfaces)
- PCA is applied to reduce dimensionality
- Important facial features are extracted as **eigenfaces**
- Whitening is applied for better classification
- Different numbers of PCA components (k values) are tested

---

### 3. Classification (ANN)
- A **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** is used
- Two hidden layers: **100 → 50 neurons**
- ReLU activation function
- Adam optimizer
- Backpropagation for training

---

### 4. Performance Evaluation
- Training and testing accuracy
- Accuracy vs number of PCA components
- Visual inspection of predictions

---

### 5. Impostor Testing
- Synthetic impostor faces generated by adding noise
- Prediction confidence evaluated
- Faces below confidence threshold are rejected
- Impostor rejection rate calculated

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
